# Related Topics

This week is focused on looking at other investigations beyond the
computation of stop rates and calculating the results of the Veil of
Darkness study. Some of these topic look at the same data more
closely, while others follow a different path altogether.

## Topics

* Propensity Score Matching in Veil of Darkness.
* Race of the officer and driver in traffic stop searches.
* Predictive policing and feedback loops.

## Reading and Analyses

* (Propensity Score Matching). Propensity score matching is a
  technique that attempts to reduce the bias due to confounding
  variables, when estimating a treatment effect. This technique is
  used by researchers in the SDSU study on racial bias in traffic
  stops (See page 52). See for example, Section 3.3.2 [Mostly Harmless
  Econometrics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51992844_Mostly_Harmless_Econometrics_An_Empiricist's_Companion/link/00b4953344a9a0cb13000000/download).

* (Race of Officer and Driver). Searches during traffic stops in
  Boston are investigated in [this paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w10634.pdf)

* (Predictive Policing). [Predictive
  policing](https://www.predpol.com/) has been used for things like
  officer resourcing for at least a decade. These are beginning to be
  [studied](https://hrdag.org/publications/to-predict-and-serve/),
  though data is hard to come by. Additionally, algorithms trained on the
  output of the algorithms previous actions may result in [feedback
  loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09847).
  
    

## Questions to Answer before Lab on *Friday*

Investigate at least one of the topics covered in section to inform
possible project proposals. To help form groups, answer the following
questions in the form linked below *before* lab hours on Friday. Lab
hours from 9:00-9:50 on Friday are *mandatory* to attend.

Questions:

* Give three questions you might be interested in investigating.
* What is one aspect of the veil of darkness approach that you might
  like to try improve?
* Give 3 other types of data (datasets, or variables) might you be
  interested in using. These could be columns in the RIPA datasets,
  columns available in other municipalities, census data, violent
  crime or police calls data, etc.
