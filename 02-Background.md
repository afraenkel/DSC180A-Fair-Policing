# Background: Police, Traffic, and Discrimination

## Topics
* Measures of inequality: False Positives in context
* Particulars of traffic stops; impacts of traffic stops; the roads in the USA
* History of Policing in the USA: the start of predictive policing

## Reading and Analyses

* [Suspect Citizens: What 20 Million Traffic Stops Tell Us About Policing and Race](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNP1QS6/) by [Frank R. Baumgartner](https://fbaum.unc.edu/), Derek A. Epp, Kelsey Shoub

* Download [San Diego traffic stops data](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-vehicle-stops/) and familiarize yourself with the fields in the data (perform a cursory EDA).

* Skim [Traffic Enforcement in San Diego  Report](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/sdpdvehiclestopsfinal.pdf) and use chapters 1/2 to contrast North Carolina and San Diego.

## Discussion questions from the reading/data

* What is the role of police in a democracy? What relationship do they
  have with citizens of the location? Be sure to consider the role
  that both law-creation and law-enforcement play in such a society.
* What are the possible purposes of traffic stops? Reconcile these
  purposes in the San Diego police data (e.g. using the `stop_cause`
  field), when possible.
* Summarize the impacts of the court cases Terry and Whren on policing
  in the United States. 
* List some ways to identify stops based on ‘pretext’ versus ‘road
  safety’ in the data.
* What is the difference between the (driving) population in North
  Carolina and San Diego? What differences in results might you expect
  to find in a similar analysis of San Diego?
* Suppose you train three "predictive policing" classifiers that
  predict: whether a driver will be stopped, whether a stopped driver
  will be arrested, and whether a searched driver possessed
  contraband. Carefully think through the meaning of false
  positives/negatives in each model.
