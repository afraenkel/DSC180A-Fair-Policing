# Causal Inference I

## Topics

* Implementing the Veil of Darkness.

## Reading and Analyses

* Read the Veil of Darkness on the Stanford Open Policing Tutorial, as
  well as the [SDSU
  Study](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/sdpdvehiclestopsfinal.pdf)
  
* Recreate the Veil of Darkness study on SD data. You may find the
  OpenPolicing tutorial useful. Note, this study doesn't use
  stop-rate, but a different measurement! (When doing this, flexibly
  structure your code; you will be expected to compute these results
  across years/places for assignment-2).

* Continue working on stop rates by census block.

## Discussion questions from reading 

* Suspect citizens suggests that past police interactions may affect
  current behavior.  How does this affect the Veil of Darkness
  experimental design? Can we still causally estimate the effect
  of observed race? How would this change the interpretation of our
  estimates?
