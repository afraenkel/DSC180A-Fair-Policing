## Introduction

* Tags: Causal Methods, Discrimination, Data Journalism, Policy
* Data: Administrative data, Geographical Data
* Methods: Causal Inference, Natural Experiments.

The most common point of contact between police and residents are
through traffic stops. While traffic stops help keep the roads safe,
police also have a host of other reasons behind them, and these stops
can have wildly different effects on the drivers being pulled
over. This project will initially look at how various notions of
fairness play out in traffic stops in San Diego in 2014-2015. In
particular, the project approaches the question “does being identified
as a certain race cause a person to get pulled over more often?”

## Background

The current state of law enforcement in the United States is the
result of a long history, heavily influenced by the legacy of slavery,
the rise of the automobile, and the war on crime. Some of this history
is covered in the following references:

  Policing and Race](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNP1QS6/) by [Frank R. Baumgartner](https://fbaum.unc.edu/), Derek A. Epp, Kelsey Shoub
* [Policing the Open Road: How Cars Transformed American
  Freedom](https://www.amazon.com/Policing-Open-Road-Transformed-American-ebook/dp/B07QGB1QCF)

## Data

Open data on traffic stops exist in cities and states throughout the
United States. 

* The project will primarily use [San Diego traffic stops data](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-vehicle-stops/).
* Stanford open policing has [cleaned traffic stops
  data](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) collected from across
  the country. This is a good reference source, but use the original
  source when possible.

### Possible Projects

* Scale the Veil of Darkness across the country and *visualize* the results.
* Do traffic stops serve the purpose of "keeping the roads safe?" (can
  a purpose be inferred?)
* Is there a difference between state patrol and local?
* Fine grained description of racial disparities in stops and
  searches.
* What various causes have what effect on being searched?
* Causal Inference Algorithms: Deconfounder, Causal Forest.
