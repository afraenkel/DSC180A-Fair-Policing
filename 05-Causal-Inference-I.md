# Causal Inference I

## Topics
* Continue Descriptive Statistics and Cleaning
* Identify Confounders in causal explanations
* Prepare the Veil of Darkness Data

## Reading and Analyses
  
* Continue replicating the analysis of *Suspect Citizens* on traffic
  stop rates using the 2015 San Diego data (expanding as time
  permits). Compute stop-rates by service area (and race) using the
  geo-spatial techniques described last week.
    
* Create a dataset consisting only of traffic stops during
  inter-twilight periods, to prepare for the veil of darkness
  analysis.
  
* Listen to [this
  podcast](https://thewaroncars.org/2019/10/31/the-automotive-police-state/)
  based on the book 'Policing the Open Road' by Sarah Seo for more
  background on the topic of traffic stops.
  
## Discussion questions from reading and analysis

* The denominator used for the stop rates by service area is
  imperfect. Pinpoint places in SD that you think the rate is an
  under-estimate. Do the same for areas that are likely
  over-estimates. Explain why this may be.
* Explain whether the spatial join biased your stop-rates.
* Understand the inter-twilight period. Why do we restrict ourselves
  to looking only at that data? What does it allow us to infer beyond
  what analyzed across all time?
* What are the limitations of restricting ourselves to analyzing the
  inter-twilight period? Be specific in relation to the data at hand.
